# Operating-Systems

All of the operations in the three phases were made using Linux system calls, pipes and the sort program.

## This project has 3 different phases.

On phase 1, the entries of two different sorted files are merged into an output file, keeping the alphabetic sorting that was used in the input files

Phase 2 scales phase 1 up to 4 files, and even to n files in the "valorização" directory ( assuming n = 2^n )

Phase 3 takes in 4 unsorted files and writes to stdout the sorted result of the merge of these files.
